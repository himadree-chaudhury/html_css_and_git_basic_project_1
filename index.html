            <h2>WELC0ME TO DEVELOPER JOURNEY...</h2>
            <p>All great journeys start with a map, a formal way of understanding how to arrive at a destination or achieve a goal. As such, the Developer Journey Map is an invaluable tool in your developer relations program. As developers are increasingly influencing or making decisions about which technologies to adopt, itâ€™s important that you formally map out the journey they have to take from initially discovering your company and product all the way through to them scaling with it. Then you need to deliver it in the most frictionless way possible....</p>

             <p>Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering approaches to the development of software.

            A software engineer is a person who applies the principles of software engineering to design, develop, maintain, test, and evaluate computer software. The term programmer is sometimes used as a synonym, but may also lack connotations of engineering education or skills.
                
            Engineering techniques are used to inform the software development process which involves the definition, implementation, assessment, measurement, management, change, and improvement of the software life cycle process itself. It heavily uses software configuration management which is about systematically controlling changes to the configuration, and maintaining the integrity and traceability of the configuration and code throughout the system life cycle. Modern processes use software versioning.....</p>
